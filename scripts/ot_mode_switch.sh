# Switch the Toon's OT data path between three topologies.
#
#   off        Original Toon behaviour: happ_thermstat owns /dev/ttymxc0
#              directly, no bridge. OTGW set to GW=1 (relay master traffic).
#              Bulletproof fallback — use if anything goes wrong with proxy.
#              No PWA boiler card (flow/return/ch_setpoint not published).
#
#   proxy      *** NEW DEFAULT, verified 2026-05-18 ***
#              quby_bridge in proxy mode: bind-mounts a PTY over
#              /dev/ttymxc0, opens the real UART, shuttles every byte
#              between happ_thermstat (via PTY) and keteladapter (via
#              UART) 1:1 without faking responses. Sniffs each Quby
#              frame and publishes BoilerInfo/ThermostatInfo notifies
#              on BoxTalk so toonui (and any future consumer) sees live
#              boiler flow/return/control-setpoint/burner. Original Toon
#              heating behaviour preserved (happ stooklijn unaffected).
#              OTGW still on GW=1.
#
#   wireless   quby_bridge in active mode: bind-mounts a PTY and FAKES
#              keteladapter responses, forwarding OT writes to OTGW
#              over HTTP. OTGW set to GW=2 (operate without thermostat).
#              Setpoint write path still blocked at OTGW firmware level
#              (HTTP CS=/CH= overrides not driving boiler). Keep for
#              future RE work; do not use for daily heating.
