# freetoon-lvgl

A from-scratch UI and integration stack for the **Eneco Toon 1 / Toon 2** smart
thermostat that runs entirely on the device — no cloud, no Quby login, no
subscription. The stock Qt UI is replaced with an LVGL app; a small constellation
of side processes brings the hardware back to life (boiler, P1 meter, vent,
weather, packages) and exposes everything over a tiny progressive web app so
you can also drive the house from your phone.

*Live capture from the device — clock ticking, vent fan spinning, water flow & energy values updating in real time.*

## Why

Eneco discontinued cloud support for the original Toon: no more app, no more
weather, no more package tracking, no more software updates. The device itself
is a perfectly capable iMX28 box with a 1024×600 touchscreen, an OpenTherm
adapter, an i.MX P1-meter UART and a humidity/temperature sensor — too good to
land on a shelf.

`freetoon-lvgl` keeps the thermostat doing what it's good at (running OpenTherm,
modulating the boiler, reading the room) while replacing the parts that
required a server somewhere:

| Lost piece | Replacement |
|---|---|
| Eneco cloud UI | LVGL app on the framebuffer + LVGL "dim" ambient screen |
| Mobile app | Self-hosted PWA served from the Toon itself |
| Weather forecast | Direct Buienradar pull |
| Energy graphs | P1 bridge → MQTT → Home Assistant (or local view) |
| Package tracking | IMAP-driven HA automation → MQTT → on-device banner |
| Ventilation control | Itho Wifi addon REST API integration |
| Schedule editor | Native LVGL screen + PWA editor |

## Screens

### Home
The default LVGL screen. Big tiles for the main signals — indoor temperature
and setpoint, boiler state (with the original-Toon-style radiator+flame icon
when CH is firing), waste-collection reminders, live energy + gas, ventilation
preset + RPM, water flow, curtains. A 5-day weather forecast lives at the
bottom. Tap the heater tile for OT detail; tap the gear-corner for settings.

![Home](docs/screenshots/home.png)

### Dim / ambient
After the configured idle timeout the screen drops to a near-black ambient
view: clock, indoor temperature with a small radiator+flame indicator when
the boiler is firing, vent fan spinner on the left mirroring the flame on
the right, top trash hint, top-right outdoor temperature, package banners
at the top, weather strip at the bottom.

![Dim](docs/screenshots/dim.png)

### Heater detail
Tap the heater tile from home to see boiler-side telemetry — flow + return
water temps, modulation level, CH setpoint from the stooklijn, water
pressure, eCO₂ / TVOC / humidity. The `Advanced` button opens a full dump
of every OpenTherm DataId currently tracked by OTGW.

### PWA
Served at `http://<toon>:10081/` from the device itself. Same controls as the
LVGL screen plus a packages list with manual entry and the weekly schedule
editor. Add to Home Screen for a phone-app feel; works offline-first via a
small service worker.

```

`toonui` is the only new long-running process on the device. The stock
`qt-gui` is removed from `inittab` so it can't fight for the framebuffer;
`toonui` is added with `respawn` so init brings it back on crash. Config
lives at `/mnt/data/toonui.cfg`; logs go to `/var/volatile/tmp/toonui.log`.

## Building

Cross-compile for the Toon's ARMv7 hardfloat target. The Makefile expects a
Linaro toolchain at `/tmp/qt_rebuild/linaro/`:

```bash
cd lvgl_ui_recovered/src
make            # produces ../build/toonui
```

Native build for desktop development (SDL2 driver) is also supported via the
LVGL submodule; see `src/Makefile` for the targets.

## Deploying

`install.sh` does an end-to-end install from a development host to a fresh
Toon — pulls the toolchain, builds, copies `toonui` + PWA + scripts to
`/mnt/data/`, patches `inittab`. SSH access is required (the Toon's stock
`hcb_config` flips the SSH server on via the Internals menu).

The default deploy expects:

* Toon reachable as `toon@<ip>` (default password `toon`)
* `/mnt/data/` mounted RW (it is, on stock firmware)
* A reachable MQTT broker for the packages banner and (optionally) P1 telemetry
* Home Assistant (optional, for curtain control / push notifications)

Edit `lvgl_ui_recovered/src/settings.c` defaults or `/mnt/data/toonui.cfg`
on-device to point at your own IPs.

## Status

The thermostat path is **the** path on this install — `happ_thermstat` →
`keteladapter` over the Quby protocol, with `quby_bridge` patched to mimic
the discontinued BoilerAdapter bit-for-bit. OTGW runs in GW=1 (relay) mode
and forwards the same OpenTherm frames the original BA produced, so the
boiler's CH/DHW state machines see no change from when Eneco's hardware was
in the loop. Verified by warming a 17.9 °C room to 20.0 °C unattended.

The repo is opinionated to one physical install (the author's), and parts
of the integration glue (HA entities, MQTT topic names, Itho user/password
location) are tuned to that environment. The LVGL UI and the core BoxTalk /
Quby / OTGW plumbing are portable; the per-integration screens are easy to
disable.
